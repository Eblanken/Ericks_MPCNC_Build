SKR V1.3 w/ TMC2208 Drivers,A decent cheap 32 bit board. Somebody else already wrote a marlin profile with dual end stop support specifically for the MPCNC which is why I went with this. The SKR V1.4 may be a cheap upgrade but I did not want to fiddle with profiles on the first pass. TMC2208s were chosen b/c the marlin profile used them but later TMC chips have more features and trinamic drivers may be superior.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RXQPKLY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1,1,$44.99,
