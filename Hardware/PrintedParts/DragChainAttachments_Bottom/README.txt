# Summary

This is a cable carrier AKA "drag chain" for the MPCNC machine X and Y axis.  It mounts under the roller block so there is no extra width added to the frame.  The Z axis is here. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1296042

The plate hole pattern fits a 10x15 chain carrier available from Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00880AVL2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00  This chain is installed now, so I know it works, but I may be upsizing to a 10x30 because there are a lot of cables coming from the extruder head.A router head may not need the larger cable carrier. 

The design of this plate will allow most any cable carrier to fit, as it is a simple plate mount.  I have a version with and without holes, so you can make your own holes as needed.

I also checked the fit for the IE version on my CAD software and it looks like it will fit that as well with no mods.  If someone with an IE machine can verify the physical fit in the comments that would be great.  Update- It does work with the IE version!

Extra hardware needed:  To install, simply replace the four 1.25" mounting bolts with 1.5" bolts.  I also used four 6-32 x .5" flat head screws and lock nuts to mount my drag chain, your chain may be different.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerGear
Printer: M2
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .25
Infill: 50%

Notes: 
3 walls, tops, and bottoms.  You will need supports.  I recommend printing two at a time.  I used PLA.

# Post-Printing

You may have to drill out the holes slightly for an easy fit.  As it is comes off my printer, the bolts will screw in, but not push in.  A 5/16 drill bit is perfect.

I also had to do a bit of cleanup on the overhangs, but it was no big deal and they can't really be seen anyway.
